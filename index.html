         <p>'CAUSE HE BUILDS STUFF!</p>
         <p>He is a true creative and has the brains to back it up!
         He's built his kids desks, doll houses, farm equipment and his own
         welded-metal art. If you think that's great? He built the house
         that we grew up in with his own two hands!</p>

       <div class="paris suggestion">
         <p>'CAUSE HE STANDS BY YOU!</p>
         <p>He has been working his buns of for how many years?!! He has taken pride
         in working his land for his family and provided all of us with a life, to which we are so grateful. I consider myself beyond lucky to have such a person in my life! Let alone that he is my Dad!</p>
       </div>
       <div class="cancun suggestion">
         <p>'CAUSE HE'S MODEST!</p>
         <p>As smart, hard-working and able as he is, I don't think I've ever met anyone as humble about it than my Dad. He is the true essense of authentic. I don't believe he has a false bone in his body... and for that and many other reasons he has been one of my greatest role models. We are lucky to know him!</p>
